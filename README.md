# Music Distribution App

## Overview
Welcome to the **Music Distribution App**! This is an exciting platform where users can upload, share, and purchase music beats or samples. The platform ensures that every track uploaded is verified for copyright and ownership before being approved. Once verified, the music gets a digital certificate and can be used or sold by other creators. 

The app allows creators to interact with others and helps musicians to grow their network. Users can upload their tracks, keep track of their status (pending, approved), and ensure all their work is protected under a digital license. ðŸŽ¶

## Features
- **User Authentication**: Log in using Google or through a local email and password system.
- **Track Uploads**: Upload beats or music samples for review.
- **Copyright & Ownership Verification**: Every uploaded track is checked for copyrights before being approved.
- **Digital License**: Tracks that pass verification are issued a digital license with ownership rights.
- **Track Status**: See the status of your uploaded tracks (pending, approved).
- **Music Marketplace**: Purchase and sell tracks from other creators.
- **Dashboard**: View your uploaded tracks, see your licenses, and manage your music collection.
